Overview
This SQL script is designed to clean and standardize the data in the NashvilleHousing table from the PortfolioProject2 database. 
The cleaning process involves standardizing date formats, populating missing addresses, splitting address columns, replacing values in a column,
removing duplicates, and restructuring the table for easier querying.

Steps
1. Viewing the Data
The script starts by selecting all columns from the NashvilleHousing table to examine the data.

2. Standardizing Date Format
The script converts the SaleDate column to the standard date format by removing unnecessary time information.

3. Populating Property Address Data
The script populates missing PropertyAddress values by using the ParcelID to match records with similar IDs and fill in the missing addresses.

4. Splitting the PropertyAddress Column
The PropertyAddress column is split into separate columns: PropertySplitAddress and PropertySplitCity for easier querying.

5. Splitting the OwnerAddress Column
The OwnerAddress column is also split into OwnerSplitAddress, OwnerSplitCity, and OwnerSplitState using a combination of PARSENAME and REPLACE functions.

6. Replacing Values in SoldAsVacant
The script standardizes the SoldAsVacant column by replacing 'Y' with 'Yes' and 'N' with 'No'.

7. Removing Duplicates
The script removes duplicate rows by using the ROW_NUMBER() function to identify duplicates based on specific columns (ParcelID, PropertyAddress, 
SalePrice, SaleDate, legalreference) and then deleting them.

8. Dropping Unnecessary Columns
Finally, the script drops unnecessary columns (SaleDate, PropertyAddress, TaxDistrict, OwnerAddress) from the table to simplify it.

Conclusion
After executing the script, the NashvilleHousing table is cleaned and structured for more efficient querying and data analysis. 
The final table is streamlined, with standardized dates, complete addresses, and no duplicates, making it easier to perform further data analysis.
